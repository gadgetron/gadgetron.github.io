Prerequisites
-------------

* Some basic knowledge of MRI reconstruction
* [Docker](https://docker.com) if you are working on a Linux computer or [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) if you are on Windows or Mac.
* An HDF5 viewer. Here we use [HDFView](https://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/) but you can also read the images into Matlab or Python for display.

TL;DR
-----

In case you want to dig straight in:

    $ docker run -t --name gt1 --detach --volume $(pwd):/opt/data gadgetron/ubuntu_1404_cuda75
	
This will (first download and then) launch the Gadgetron in a Docker container. It will also mount your current folder as a data folder inside the container. To enter the container:

    $ docker exec -ti gt1 /bin/bash
	
Inside the container generate some data:

    $ cd /opt/data
    $ ismrmrd_generate_cartesian_shepp_logan

Send the data for reconstruction in the Gadgetron:

    $ gadgetron_ismrmrd_client -f testdata.h5 -c default.xml -o out.h5
	
Open the `out.h5` file with an application such as [HDFView](https://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/) and look at the image.

For more details read the complete tutorial below. 


Running the Gadgetron using Docker
---------------------------------
  

If you would like to compile and install the Gadgetron and dependencies on your own system, please consult the [Gadgetron Wiki](https://github.com/gadgetron/gadgetron/wiki/Manual). We will use Docker images to simplify this procedure. 

The easiest way to get the Gadgetron installed is by using one of our pre-built and tested [Docker](https://docker.com) images, which are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/gadgetron). The most complete image (in terms of compiled features) is `gadgetron/ubuntu_1404_cuda75` which includes all GPU dependent libraries. If you don't have a GPU on your machine or if you are running the Docker container on a Windows or Mac computer (where your GPU would not be accesible), you can grab the `gadgetron/ubuntu_1404_no_cuda`. For the purposes of this tutorial, either will do.

To get started open up a shell/terminal where you have access to Docker. This can either be your standard shell on Linux or the "Docker Quickstart Terminal" on [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/mac/step_one/) or [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/windows/step_one/). In the terminal type:

    $ docker pull gadgetron/ubuntu_1404_cuda75
	
If this is the first time you pull this image, it could take a few minutes depending on network bandwidth and other issues. Once the pull is complete, you should be able to type:

    $ docker images

And see the available images on your machine:

{% highlight shell %}
REPOSITORY                     TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
gadgetron/ubuntu_1404_cuda75   latest              d698dcb1452b        20 hours ago        4.763 GB
{% endhighlight %}

To start a container using this image, we will use the command:

{% highlight shell %}
$ docker run -t --name gt1 --detach --volume $(pwd):/opt/data gadgetron/ubuntu_1404_cuda75
{% endhighlight %}

For a complete list of all the `docker run` options, please refer to the Docker [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/). The `-t` attaches a pseudo TTY to the container to enable us to have command line access (see later), `--detach` puts the container in the background, `--name` gives the container a convenient name (we will use that later), and `--volume $(pwd):/opt/data` maps the current directory (`pwd`) into a folder called `/opt/data` inside the container. If you execute that command from a folder where you have to data to process, you will have access to that data inside the container. If you would like to map some other folder than your current directory, you would type:

{% highlight shell %}
$ docker run -t --name gt1 --detach --volume /path/you/would/like/to/mount:/opt/data gadgetron/ubuntu_1404_cuda75
{% endhighlight %}

After starting the container, you can verify that it is running:

{% highlight shell %}
$ docker ps
{% endhighlight %}
   
you should see that you have the Gadgetron container running:

{% highlight shell %}
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                          COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
e550555a4858        gadgetron/ubuntu_1404_cuda75   "/usr/bin/supervisord"   2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes                            gt1
{% endhighlight %}

You are now ready to run Gadgetron reconstructions. 

One note regarding access to GPU inside the container. At the moment this only works on Linux machines. NVIDIA provides a drop-in replacement for the `docker` command called `nvidia-docker`, which you can find [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker). We also provide a [script](https://github.com/gadgetron/gadgetron/blob/master/docker/nvidia-docker) in the Gadgetron code, which performs a similar function. These tools will expose the GPU inside the container and allow you to do GPU reconstructions. For more details, please consult the [Wiki](https://github.com/gadgetron/gadgetron/wiki/Using-Docker).

Running the Hello World example
-------------------------------

First step to working with the running Gadgetron is to get a command line (shell) inside the container:

	$ docker exec -ti gt1 bash

The `-ti` options give us an interactive terminal, `gt1` refers to the name of the container that we used above and `bash` is the command to execute inside the container. 

Once you are inside the container, you can navigate to the data folder that we mapped:

	$ cd /opt/data
	
If you had any data files in your current directory when you started the container, you should see them here by typing `ls`. We will not assume that you have any data yet, so we will use the `ismrmrd_generate_cartesian_shepp_logan` application from the [ISMRMRD](https://ismrmrd.github.io) package to generate a dataset. 

{% highlight shell %}
$ ismrmrd_generate_cartesian_shepp_logan 
Generating Cartesian Shepp Logan Phantom!!!
Acceleration: 1
{% endhighlight %}

For more options for this application you can type `ismrmrd_generate_cartesian_shepp_logan -h`. The application should generate a `testdata.h5` file in your current folder, which will contain a simulated dataset in ISMRMRD format 

To reconstruct the test data type:

{% highlight shell %}
$ gadgetron_ismrmrd_client -f testdata.h5 -o out.h5 -c default.xml
{% endhighlight %}

The `-f` option is the input file, `-o` is the output file and `-c` indicates the Gadgetron reconstruction that should be run. The `gadgetron_ismrmrd_client` has a few options, which you can list with `gadgetron_ismrmrd_client -h`. As indicated by the name, this program is a client, which connects (via a TCP/IP connection) to a Gadgetron server. This server is already running in the container and receiving connections on port `9002`, which is the default port for the Gadgetron. If you want to connect to a Gadgetron running on a different port, use the `-p` argument. 

After running the reconstruction, you can open up the `out.h5` file in [HDFView](https://www.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/). When you run a new reconstruction, the default behavior of the `gadgetron_ismrmrd_client` is to append another group to the HDF5 file with the current date and time. If you keep running reconstructions they will be appended to the time file and organized by time. If you navigate to the `image_0/data` variable under the last recon group, you can right-click and select "Open As". This will bring up a dialog window where you can select "Image" and specify the ordering of the dimensions to display. If you select "Height" to be "dim 3", "Width" to be "dim 4" and "Depth" to be "dim 0", you should be able to view the resulting image as illustrated below:

![Hello World Result](/images/hello_world_result.png)

Modifying a reconstruction
--------------------------

Next step is to modify the reconstruction program that we just used. We will add a raw data filter.

Before we get to that, let's take a closer look at the XML files that define reconstruction programs. You will find the available configurations in `/usr/local/share/gadgetron/config`. If you open up the `default.xml` program that we used above, you will see that it consists of `reader`, `writer`, and `gadget` definitions. The readers and writers represent the datatypes that this reconstruction program will be able to read (receive) from and write (return) to the client. The default chain is able to read ISMRMRD acquisitions and write MRI images:

{% highlight xml %}
    <reader>
      <slot>1008</slot>
      <dll>gadgetron_mricore</dll>
      <classname>GadgetIsmrmrdAcquisitionMessageReader</classname>
    </reader>

    <writer>
      <slot>1022</slot>
      <dll>gadgetron_mricore</dll>
      <classname>MRIImageWriter</classname>
    </writer>
{% endhighlight %}

The Gadgets represent signal processing modules. The data passes from one module to the next. Each of the `gadget` definitions consist of a name, a shared library (DLL) that this Gadget is found in, and the class name of the Gadget. For instance

{% highlight xml %}
    <gadget>
        <name>RemoveROOversampling</name>
        <dll>gadgetron_mricore</dll>
        <classname>RemoveROOversamplingGadget</classname>
    </gadget>
{% endhighlight %}

adds a Gadget with a class name of `RemoveROOversamplingGadget` from the shared library `gadgetron_mricore`. On Linux, this library would be called `libgadgetron_mricore.so`. You can find more details about this Gadget with the command

	$ gadgetron_info gadgetron_mricore RemoveROOversamplingGadget
	
The tool `gadgetron_info` can give you information about the computer running the Gadgetron and which version of the software you are running. If you ever need to report a problem or a bug, please include the output of `gadgetron_info`.

The `default.xml` chain contains the following Gadgets:

* `RemoveROOversamplingGadget`: Removes the readout oversampling
* `AcquisitionAccumulateTriggerGadget`: Collects lines of k-space until a certain trigger condition is encountered, i.e., when there is enough data to reconstruct an image.
* `BucketToBufferGadget`: Inserts the collected data into a buffer more suitable for recon processing.
* `SimpleReconGadget`: Performs a simple FFT reconstruction. 
* `ImageArraySplitGadget`: The previous Gadget may return an array of images and this Gadget splits them into individual images.
* `ExtractGadget`: Extracts the magnitude of the complex images.
* `ImageFinishGadget`: Returns the image to the client. 

Our task of inserting a raw data filter is now as simple as inserting a Gadget in the beginning of the chain. Most of the Gadgets in the Gadgetron are written in C++ but they can also be written in scripting languages (Python or Matlab). To illustrate this, we will write a Python Gadget. 

Simply open up a text editor and start editing a file called `/usr/local/share/gadgetron/python/FilterGadget.py`. `emacs` and `vim` are available in the container. Enter the following code:

{% highlight python %}
import numpy as np
from gadgetron import Gadget

class RawFilter(Gadget):
    def process(self, head, data):
        filt = np.reshape(np.hanning(data.shape[0]),(data.shape[0],1))
        data2 = data * filt
        self.put_next(head,data2)
        return 0
{% endhighlight %}

Now we need to add this Gadget to the `default.xml` chain. It is recommended that you copy the `default.xml` chain to a new file first:

	$ cd /usr/local/share/gadgetron/config
	$ cp default.xml default_filter.xml

Now edit the `default_filter.xml` file and add the following `gadget` definition before the `RemoveROOversamplingGadget` definition:

{% highlight xml %}
    <gadget>
      <name>FilterGadget</name>
      <dll>gadgetron_python</dll>
      <classname>PythonGadget</classname>
      <property>
        <name>python_module</name>
        <value>FilterGadget</value>
      </property>
      <property>
        <name>python_class</name>
        <value>RawFilter</value>
      </property>
    </gadget>
{% endhighlight %}

Save the file and now run your new reconstruction on the test data that we created above:

	$ gadgetron_ismrmrd_client -f testdata.h5 -o out.h5 -c default_filter.xml

The figure below illustrates the result from the Hello World example side by side with the result from the new chain. It should be clear that the new result is filtered.

Converting and Reconstructing real data
---------------------------------------

The examples above used simulated data. You would of course want to use real data. Since the Gadgetron supports the ISMRMRD format for MRI data, you can use the Gadgetron as long as you can convert your data to ISMRMRD format. Please look at the [ISMRMRD Github](https://github.com/ismrmrd) for a converter for your preferred vendor. The Docker image comes with some converters already installed. In this example, we will convert a Siemens raw data file to ISMRMRD format and reconstruct it. 

In this example we will use the `meas_MID03485_FID51095_se.dat` file from the [ISMRMRD paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.26089/full) raw dataset which can be downloaded from [http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.33166](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.33166). Download the file and place it in the folder that is mounted inside the Docker container. 

The example dataset is a more complicated case. The `meas_MID03485_FID51095_se.dat` file actually contains two measurements: 1) a noise calibration and 2) the actual measurement data. The noise data can be used for noise prewhitening. To convert the file type:

	$ siemens_to_ismrmrd -f meas_MID03485_FID51095_se.dat -z 1 -o noise.h5
	$ siemens_to_ismrmrd -f meas_MID03485_FID51095_se.dat -z 2 -o data.h5
	
This puts the first measurement (`-z 1`) into a file called `noise.h5` and the measurement data into a file called `data.h5`. We can run these through the Gadgetron one after another. First the noise:

	$ gadgetron_ismrmrd_client -f noise.h5 -c default_measurement_dependencies.xml
	
This will not actually produce any images, it will simply process the noise data and store it in the Gadgetron. Then we run the actual scan:

	$ gadgetron_ismrmrd_client -f data.h5 -c Generic_Cartesian_Grappa_SNR.xml
	
This will produce a new group in the `out.h5` file. If we look at the first image series `image_0` in that, we should see an image:

![Kiwi Image](/images/kiwi.png)

You will notice that this reconstruction produce other image series as well. How many depends on whether this scan uses parallel imaging or not. The `image_300` series is an image scaled to units of SNR and the `image_1000` series is a plot of the noise standard deviation in each channel. This is a very useful plot for coil QA:

![Noise Plot](/images/noise_plot.png)

Next Steps
----------

This concludes the brief tutorial of the Gadgetron. You should explore the `/usr/local/share/gadgetron/config` folder where you will find many different reconstruction programs. You can also try to implement the raw filter Gadget from above in C++. A good place to start would be the [`AcquisitionPassthroughGadget`](https://github.com/gadgetron/gadgetron/blob/master/gadgets/mri_core/AcquisitionPassthroughGadget.h), which could easily be modified to filter the data rather than let it pass straight through.
